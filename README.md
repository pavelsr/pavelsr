## Hi there üëã

I‚Äôm Pavel - I‚Äôve been in IT for ~15 years. Since 2022, I‚Äôve been running my own business, building custom software, providing outstaffing services, and growing pet projects with startup potential. My clients range from global giants (Yandex, Otkritie Bank - now VTB, Tinkoff - now T-Bank, universities like MIT, SFedU, and Innopolis, Litres, 220 Volt, REG.RU) to mid-size companies (small ISPs, factories, a Korean casino, a Finnish robotics school) and various Skolkovo startups aiming for international growth.

This mix of big-tech scale projects and fast-paced startup launches gives me a unique edge ‚Äì I can combine strategic vision with rapid, tangible results.

My guiding principle in IT is simple: build things that are useful and profitable, balancing immediate wins with long-term value.

## How We Can Collaborate

I‚Äôm interested in exploring collaboration around **narrow/technical topics**, such as:  
- **LLMs and RAG** (what‚Äôs often called vanilla-RAG today)  
- **Building cost-efficient cloud services**  
- **Bug-bounty programs** via HackerOne and Standoff365 
- **EdTech and TravelTech projects**  
- **Collaborative dataset creation**

I‚Äôm also passionate about **broader themes**, including AI, cybersecurity, tech culture, DIY, industrial tourism, and cycling. If any of these resonate with you, feel free to reach out ‚Äì usually, a conversation quickly clarifies how we can work together üòâ
